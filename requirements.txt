# ====================================
# 5G NTN Testbed - Python Dependencies
# ====================================
# Updated for Software-Only Simulation (No Hardware Required)

# ============ CORE DEPENDENCIES ============

# Numerical Computing (REQUIRED)
numpy>=1.21.0
scipy>=1.7.0

# Plotting and Visualization (REQUIRED)
matplotlib>=3.4.0

# Configuration Management (REQUIRED)
pyyaml>=5.4.0

# ============ OPTIONAL: GPU ACCELERATION ============
# Uncomment ONE of these for GPU support (10-100x speedup):
# cupy-cuda12x>=11.0.0  # For CUDA 12.x (RTX 40-series, A100, H100)
# cupy-cuda11x>=11.0.0  # For CUDA 11.x (RTX 30-series, V100, A40)
#
# Or install manually:
#   pip install cupy-cuda12x  # CUDA 12
#   pip install cupy-cuda11x  # CUDA 11
#
# GPU is OPTIONAL - simulation works perfectly on CPU

# ============ COMMUNICATION & WEB ============

# Async and Concurrency
aiohttp>=3.8.0

# Web Framework (for monitoring interface)
flask>=2.0.0
requests>=2.26.0

# ============ DATA PROCESSING ============

# Data Processing and Analysis
pandas>=1.3.0

# ============ HARDWARE INTERFACE (OPTIONAL - not needed for simulation) ============
# These are ONLY needed if you have physical USRP hardware
# For software simulation, these are NOT required

# USRP Hardware Interface (OPTIONAL - hardware only)
# uhd>=4.2.0

# Instrument Control (OPTIONAL - hardware only)
# pyvisa>=1.11.0
# pyvisa-py>=0.5.0
# pyserial>=3.5

# ============ TESTING TOOLS ============

# Testing Framework
pytest>=7.0.0
pytest-asyncio>=0.18.0
pytest-benchmark>=3.4.0

# ============ MONITORING ============

# Monitoring and Logging
prometheus-client>=0.12.0

# ============ DEVELOPMENT TOOLS ============

# Jupyter Notebooks
jupyter>=1.0.0
ipython>=7.0.0
notebook>=6.4.0

# Code Quality
black>=21.0
pylint>=2.12.0
mypy>=0.950

# Type Stubs
types-PyYAML>=6.0.0
types-requests>=2.28.0

# ============ DOCKER/KUBERNETES (automatically handled) ============
# These are included in Docker images, no need to install locally:
# - docker
# - kubernetes (kubectl)
# - kind

# ============ SUMMARY ============
# For basic simulation (CPU-only):
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# For GPU acceleration:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#   pip install cupy-cuda12x  # or cupy-cuda11x
#
# For hardware interfacing (physical USRP):
#   Uncomment uhd, pyvisa lines above
#
# Quick start:
#   ./scripts/quick_start.sh --gpu  # with GPU
#   ./scripts/quick_start.sh        # CPU only
